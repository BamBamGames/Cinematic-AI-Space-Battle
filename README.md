# Cinematic AI Space Battle

# Proposal

I plan on implementing the following:

- Some sort of strategic AI systems for deploying fleets of ships (Leader making decisions, followers following instructions)
- All of the ships will use AI behaviours to move and interact with the environment in battle
- Ships will engage in :
    - Persuits
    - One on one battles (with some randomness to simulate pilot decisions)
    - Fleet on fleet battles
    - Obstacle avoidance, such as other ships and asteroids etc
- Battles should play out differently every time and by the end should have a clear winning team
- Cutscenes will be made for different game end states
- A dynamic camera system will be implemented that will find interesting scenes of battle on the battlefield and track and film these locations

- The job system will be used to implement as many behaviours as possible to keep performance high and as many ships in battle on the scen as possible
- Asteroids will be dynamic and may react to music in the scene?
